### Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project explores Bikeshare Data from three US cities:
* New York City
* Washington DC
* Chicago

We use this data to present basic statistics regarding user age, trip duration, etc.

### Files used
bikeshare.py

CSV's for each city are used.
_See .gitignore_

### Credits

to help write this file.
